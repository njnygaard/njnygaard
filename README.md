# Hello

I'm Nikhil Nygaard and I'm most productive with Bash, Go, and JavaScript. Usually in that order.  
I'd like to spend time learning Haskell and Rust, but I haven't found the right thing to work on yet.

You can find a few of my linked identities on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/njnygaard).  
I also exist on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikhil-nygaard/).  
My personal site is [nygaard.site](https://nygaard.site).
