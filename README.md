# Hello

<!-- ![Smile](https://www.nygaard.site/img/smile-full-pixel-180x180.png) -->

I'm Nikhil Nygaard and I like being productive with JavaScript and Go. I'd like to spend time learning Haskell and Rust, but I haven't found the right thing to work on yet.

You can find a few of my linked identities on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/njnygaard).

I also exist on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikhil-nygaard/).
